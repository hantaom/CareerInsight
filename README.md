## Contributing
### Git
The default branch will be set to 'master', thus all work will be merged to here.
To start working on an issue,
1. Head over to `master` branch

   `git checkout master`  
2. Create a new branch

   `git checkout -b name/shortDescriptionOfIssue`  
   For example: `git checkout -b hantao/MainPage`  
3. After you did work, commit your changes. It's good practice to commit often and describe what you did in each commit

   `git commit -m 'added user model'`  
   
4. Commits only apply locally until you push it to your branch
   
   `git push` or  
   `git push origin hantao/MainPage`

### Pull Request
Okay, so you pushed to your branch, you checked that your branch builds, and theres no errors/warning. It's time to submit a pull request to merge into dev. Remember to
1. Fill out the pull request template that will be generated automatically
    * Issue number
    * What you did in the branch
2. Pull Request titles can just be the name of the issue
3. Get it approved before merging
